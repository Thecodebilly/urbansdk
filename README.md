Hi!

Welcome to my code.

Unfortunately I ran into a bug that I ended up not having time to figure out...

But I completed the code as if that one function does work, in the event that someone is able to see where I went wrong and I can fix it.

# setup
`python3.9 -m venv .venv`
`source .venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# data
unzip the data (hw.zip) into a .data folder

# api
`python app.py`
